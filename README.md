Disability Detection App

For detailed information: see DisabilityDetectionApp.pptx

Objective: This is a project made in the hackathon CodeUtsava 2.0, NIT Raipur (rank 10 in the competition). We have made a website having various tests related to some disabilities such as mental disability, hearing disability, visual disability. The user has to take a test and answer certain questions. On the basis of user's response, a score will be calculated demonstrating percentage (%) of disability. The tests have been made on the basis of guidelines provided by Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, India (Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities). There is also a reference for getting doctor's opinions if a user feels the need to consult.

Implementation: using PHP for back-end; HTML, CSS, JavaScript for front-end; MySQL for database.
